# Neetcode_DSA

This is a very real and very common struggle, Vasanth — and the important thing first:

You are not bad at DSA.
You’re missing pattern recognition, not knowledge.

Almost everyone hits this phase. Let me explain why this happens and how to fix it practically.

1️⃣ Why knowing data structures is NOT enough

Most people learn:

Arrays

Linked Lists

Stack, Queue

Trees, Graphs

HashMap

But interview problems are not about the structure — they are about patterns.

Example:

You know HashMap

But problem expects Sliding Window + HashMap

That’s a pattern, not a data structure

👉 DSA ≠ DS knowledge
👉 DSA = Pattern recognition + practice

2️⃣ The core mistake most people make ❌

You start a problem thinking:

“Which data structure should I use?”

Instead, you should ask:

✅ Correct thinking order

What is being asked?

What changes as I move forward?

Can I reuse previous work?

Am I looking at a range, prefix, or subarray?

Do I need to optimize brute force?

Patterns answer these questions.

3️⃣ The ONLY 14 patterns you actually need

Almost 90% of LeetCode problems fall into these:

🧩 Array / String

Sliding Window

Two Pointers

Prefix Sum

Binary Search

Sorting + Greedy

🌳 Tree

DFS (Pre/In/Post)

BFS (Level order)

Backtracking

🔗 Linked List

Fast & Slow Pointer

In-place Reversal

🧠 Advanced

Hashing

Monotonic Stack

Heap / Priority Queue

Dynamic Programming

👉 You don’t need 100 patterns.
👉 You need deep mastery of these.

4️⃣ How to RECOGNIZE patterns (this is the key 🔑)
🔹 Sliding Window

Ask:

Subarray / substring?

Longest / shortest?

Continuous?

Window expands & shrinks?

Example:

Longest substring without repeating characters
→ Sliding Window

🔹 Two Pointers

Ask:

Sorted array?

Pair / triplet?

Move inward?

Example:

Two Sum (sorted array)
→ Two pointers

🔹 HashMap

Ask:

Need frequency?

Fast lookup?

Count occurrences?

Example:

Group Anagrams
→ HashMap + Frequency

🔹 BFS (Tree)

Ask:

Level by level?

Closest?

Minimum steps?

Example:

Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
→ BFS

🔹 DFS

Ask:

Explore all paths?

Backtracking?

Depth-based?

Example:

Path Sum
→ DFS

🔹 Prefix Sum

Ask:

Repeated sum queries?

Range sum?

Cumulative?

Example:

Subarray sum equals K
→ Prefix Sum + HashMap

5️⃣ The REAL way to get good (not more videos)
❌ Wrong approach

Watch tutorials

Solve random problems

Jump between topics

✅ Right approach (this works)

For each pattern:

Learn the pattern template

Solve 5 easy

Solve 5 medium

Repeat SAME pattern again next day

Explain solution in your own words

6️⃣ What YOU should do specifically (based on your history)

From your chats, you already solved:

Sliding Window

HashMap

Tree BFS

Linked List reversal

👉 Your next gap is confidence + pattern labeling

7️⃣ Mental trick that changes everything 🧠

Before coding, force yourself to answer:

“What is changing as I move?”

Index? → pointers

Window? → sliding window

Level? → BFS

Path? → DFS

Frequency? → HashMap

The answer gives the pattern.

8️⃣ You are actually on the RIGHT path

Look at what you already did:

Sliding window optimizations

BFS trees

HashMap anagrams

Linked list reversals

That’s not beginner level.

Your problem is:

You expect pattern recognition instantly.
It comes after repetition.

-----------------------------------------------------------

How to remember this going forward (simple rule)

🧠 Add this to your internal list:

🔹 “Hidden Pattern” bucket

These are must-know interview tricks not in core lists:

Boyer–Moore Majority Vote

Kadane’s Algorithm

Floyd’s Cycle Detection

Monotonic Stack

Prefix Sum + HashMap

Binary Search on Answer

These sit on top of the 14 patterns.
